Non-Technical Introduction

D3.js, shorts for Data-Driven Documents, is a JavaScript library (written in JavaScript) for creating interactive data visualizations by connecting data to web-based documents, which can be rendered by modern web browsers, such as HTML, CSS and SVG. D3 facilitates generation and manipulation of web-based documents using data by loading and binding data to elements within the documents, then, transforming the elements based on given data and transitioning them interactively. D3’s emphasis on web standards (HTML, CSS and SVG) let it work seamlessly with existing web-based documents, and can manipulate any part of them. It offers extraordinary flexibility in data visualizations. You can implement your creative thoughts the way you want and add various functions, like zoom and click.
