**D3.js**, short for Data-Driven Documents is a JavaScript library for rendering interactive data visualizations. It helps bring data to life by connecting data to web-based documents, such as HTML, CSS and SVG. **D3** works seamlessly with web-based documents. It first loads and binds data to elements within the documents. Then it transforms the elements based on supplied data and transitions them interactively in response to user input. **D3** offers extraordinary flexibility in data visualizations. It enables you to manipulate any part of the documents and implement your creative thoughts on visualizations as you see fit.
