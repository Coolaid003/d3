**D3.js** is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. **D3** helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. **D3** emphasizes web standards and combines powerful visualization components with a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation, giving you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework.

## What to Use D3 for and When to Use it

You might come have come across **D3** as a data analyst researching visualization tools, an interested novice developer or perhaps just a curious passerby. This section is intended to provide a non-technical perspective to help you assess whether **D3** is relevant for inclusion in your project. 

If it's your first time coming across **D3**, it may be important for you to know that **D3** is not a packaged charting library with a set of pre-defined visualizations. It tackles the problem of browser-based (*or web-based*) data visualization from a deeper level and as you might expect, there's a mild learning curve involved. **D3** provides the means with which you can attach data to the HTML elements in your browser and manipulate how they render based on parameters of your choice. Exploring the extent of its capabilities requires (some) knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript, but, as illustrated by the numerous [examples](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery), the deeper approach employed by **D3** affords the user extreme flexibility in the design and UI/UX department. *(What about giving the full term User Interface and User Experience?)*

**D3** is primarily a tool for representation, not analysis. Its most potent applications are in communicating identified patterns  to an audience. It is not intended for exploratory analysis, meaning, it won't help you quickly render multiple views on the same data set for study (yet). Another point you may want to consider is how you plan on reaching your audience. *If you want to generate your interactive visualizations using web standards, instead of static images embedded on the page, you will probably want to choose d3.* As **D3** integrates seamlessly with modern web technologies, it is highly applicable to projects intended to be viewed on the web. Its high speed coupled with support for user-interaction and animation have made it an extremely popular choice for these purposes.
